# osu! map: Clonepa- Maria-sama Truly Hates You!!!

## Music source

Track 3 of this album: https://nokore.bandcamp.com/album/nkcd0002-clonepa-courroux

## Usage

If you want polished versions that I think are ready to be revised, just wait until the beatmap is updated on osu! (LINK TBD).

If you want the current version in this repo:

1. Click the green [Code] button on GitHub and download it as zip.
2. Rename the downloaded file to have the extension `.osz`.
3. Open the `.osz` file on your computer, this should extract the beatmap to your osu! songs folder.
4. Download MP3 320 format from the Bandcamp source mentioned above
5. Copy the third track (Maria-Sama Truly Hates You!!!) to the beatmap's folder.
6. Rename the track in the folder to `audio.mp3`.
